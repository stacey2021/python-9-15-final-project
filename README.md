Python-9-15 Final Project

Introduction
My project would review Museum of Modern Art(MoMa) artwork collections data. Two datasets have been pulled directly from this website: https://www.kaggle.com/momanyc/museum-collection. The first dataset contains basic information for each artwork, includes artwork title, related artist id & name, department, etc. The second dataset contains artist information, includes artist id, name, nationality, gender, etc. I would like to group the artwork collection data by department, by acquisition date and by the related artist gender & artist nationality.
