My project would review Museum of Modern Art(MoMa) artwork collections data. Two data sets have been pulled directly from this website:https://www.kaggle.com/momanyc/museum-collection. The first data set contains basic information for each artwork, includes title, artist, department, etc. The second data set contains artist information, includes artist name, nationality, gender, etc. I would like to group the artwork collection data by department, by acquisition date and by the related artist gender & artist nationality.
